Working on expanding my programming knowledge ðŸ’œ

Completed:
- Midi input system to play games using my musical keyboard

Currently working on:
- Editing a video to showcase the Midi program

  (Unfortunately I have a lot of University work too so most of my projects are currently on hold)

Future plans:
  1. A gamified way of teaching people morse code
  2. An editable and playable Jeopardy designer
  3. Updating my audio player and uploading it to github (Past project)
