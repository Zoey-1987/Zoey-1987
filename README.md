Working on expanding my programming knowledge ðŸ’œ

Completed:
- Midi input system to play games using my musical keyboard

Currently working on:
- Editing a video to showcase the Midi program

  (Unfortunately I have a lot of University work too so most of my projects are currently on hold)

Future plans:
- Custom Jeopardy maker for my friends
- A gamified way of teaching people morse code
- An audio player system for the various game OSTs I own
- A finance tracking system so I start spending less ^^
